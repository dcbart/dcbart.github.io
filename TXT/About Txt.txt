“Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.” -Pablo Picasso<br><br>

This website acts as an archive and a way to recognize art
from all year groups. For parents, teachers and students who
may have missed an exhibition, this is the chance to
appreciate the art online.<br>
Though these works of art look nice from far away, little do
you know the time, patience and skill put in to each piece. It is
important to encourage kids, to tell them that their art looks
beautiful because in art there is no right or wrong answer. It all
starts with a simple idea and putting pen to paper.<br><br>
